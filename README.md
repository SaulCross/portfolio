Accordion with dynamic JSON content:

* Stylisation developed to a strict guideline
* PHP parses dynamic content from JSON endpoint import
* Styled with jQuery and responsive web design, including cross-browser compatibility.
* The design and code development is original, apart from a resource I used to provide functionality to toggle between two functions. http://jsbin.com/ohOZEYI/5/edit?html,css,js,output
